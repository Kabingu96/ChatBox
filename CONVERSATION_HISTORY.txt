2. Monitoring and Observability
   - Health endpoint provides real-time pool metrics
   - Connection status visibility for operations teams
   - Database connectivity verification
   - Performance monitoring capabilities

3. Timeout Management
   - Context-based timeout implementation
   - Prevents resource leaks from hanging queries
   - Consistent timeout values across operations
   - Error logging for timeout scenarios

TESTING RESULTS
===============
✅ Backend builds successfully with optimizations
